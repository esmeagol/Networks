syntax: ./server <ip> <port>


Architecture:
------------
serve_tftp_clients (): It is the main flow-control function, it calls select on all available sockets in a loop,
                       select returns on two conditions:
			1) either of the sockets is ready to read data
			2) select timeout happens
			
			after select returns, it
			1) checks for retry_timeout for any of the clients, if for any client, timeout has passed the retry_interval, 
			it resends the data...
			2) calls recvfrom to fetch data from the socket ready to read, and based on which socket it is, performs actions like handling rrq 				or ack.


tftp_rrq_handler (): processes a rrq request from a new client, adds new socket in fd_list, and sends 1st chunk of file_data, if the request was legitimate.

tftp_ack_handler (): processes an ACK from client, and accordingly sends the next bunch of data to the client.

encode (), decode () - functions to pack, unpack tftp packets recieved from and sent to the client.

all defines in tftp.h
g_ prefix used for global variables.



Features:
--------
o Multiple client handling is supported and appropriately tested.
o handling for loss of packets is there. (retransmission of data based on timers)
o Send window has not been implemented.
